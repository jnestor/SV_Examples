SystemVerilog examples - common building blocks

This repository contains a library of combinational and sequential building blocks coded in SystemVerilog.

It also contains template code for simple stimulus-only and self-checking testbenches.

It is a companion to my draft book "RTL Design and Verification Using SystemVerilog"
